## CSS Architecture

This project uses a PostCSS-based workflow with nested CSS syntax
(Sass-like nesting via `postcss-nested`) and BEM methodology.

- Source CSS: `css/style.css`
- Compiled CSS: `dist/style.css`

Nested syntax is used for maintainability and clarity during development,
while the compiled output ensures full browser compatibility.
